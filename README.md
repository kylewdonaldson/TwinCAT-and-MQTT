# TwinCAT-and-MQTT
TwinCAT and MQTT sample project


This is a fork from Gerhard Barteling's, TwinCAT MQTT example project. The 'Mosquitto Test Broker' branch uses the free public Mosquitto test broker which helps get an example up and running quickly without extra 
supporting infrastructure, perfect for learning the ins and outs of a new thing :)
